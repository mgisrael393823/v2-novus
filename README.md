## Implementation Instructions for Future Claude CLI

### Step 1: Content Replacement Pattern
For each page, follow this exact pattern:
1. First, read the existing page from `/Users/michaelisrael/novus-apartments-website/src/pages/[page-name].tsx`
2. For each section, precisely replace Phoenix/Sol content with Durham/Novus content
3. Update all color references from coral (`#E57161`) to gold (`#CAB06B`)
4. Update background colors from `#FCFAF5` to `#F9F8F4`
5. Update border colors from `#E8E3D9` to `#E5E2D9`
6. Update text colors from `#777777` to `#666666`

### Step 2: Content Mapping Reference
Use these specific mappings when updating content:

| Sol Phoenix | The Novus |
|-------------|-----------|
| SOL Modern | The Novus |
| 747 units | 188 units |
| Roosevelt Row | Five Points District |
| 50 E Fillmore St, Phoenix | 115 Morris St, Durham |
| $1,965 to $4,645 | $2,150 to $8,732 |
| Studio to 3-bedroom | Studio to 2-bedroom |
| Phoenix market data | Durham market data |
| 12.5 month stabilization | 12 month stabilization |
| 4-6 weeks concessions | 1.5-2 months concessions |

### Step 3: Durham Competitors
When updating the competitive landscape, use these specific competitors:
1. Van Alen - Urban sanctuary concept with sophisticated design
2. One City Center - High-rise with rooftop pool and lounge
3. Berkshire Ninth Street - Near Duke with extensive amenities
4. Beckon Apartments - Near Central Park with Belt Line access
5. Cortland Bull City - Downtown with skyline views
6. 511 Faye - High-rise format with luxury positioning

### Step 4: Color Scheme Reference
Always use these exact hex values for consistency:
```
// The Novus Color Palette
--primary: #CAB06B; // Muted gold accent (replacing coral)
--primary-light: #E8DFC0; // Lighter gold
--primary-dark: #A38E53; // Darker gold
--background: #F9F8F4; // Soft cream/white
--text: #333333; // Same dark charcoal gray
--text-secondary: #666666; // Adjusted secondary text
--border: #E5E2D9; // Adjusted border color
--accent-blue: #A8C0D1; // Subtle blue for charts
--accent-green: #B5C9B7; // Subtle green for charts
```

### Step 5: Key Novus Project Features
Always emphasize these unique selling points:
- 27-story high-rise format (tallest residential building in downtown Durham)
- 22,000+ square feet of ground floor retail
- Premium amenities including outdoor movie theater, golf simulators, and pickleball court
- Technology-forward living with smart home features

## Important Notes for Remaining Work

2. The globals.css file has already been updated with the new color scheme
3. The Navigation.client.tsx has been updated with The Novus branding
4. The executive-summary.tsx page has been fully updated to serve as a reference
5. Never mix Sol and Novus content - ensure complete replacement
6. Maintain the same gating strategy but with Novus-specific premium content

By following these detailed instructions, you will be able to seamlessly complete the migration of the remaining pages from Sol Phoenix to The Novus Apartments.
